# Coding Challenge

Practice your React or Docker skills building on what you have learnt so far this week.
Ideas for your app:

## Extend the recipes application: 
* Add search functionality to search for a recipe
* Add image animations to the recipe app, so images change when you roll over the tiles
* Add a form to create a new recipe
* Deploy the developer-toolcamp-ui to a Docker container

## Or, do something completely different:
* Use the Star Wars Api (swapi.co) to query data and display the data on a totally new app
* You could use the React Seed Project to build your new app (https://github.ibm.com/CIC-UK/react-seed-project )
* Or build on the Hello World app.

Work in groups of 2 â€“ 3 or by yourself.
