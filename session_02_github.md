## What is Git?
**Git** is a version control and source code management tool. It provides many benefits:
* **Distributed development** - each developer has a local copy of the repository and there is also a remote copy on a server.
* **Concurrent development** - many developers can work on the same code base simultaneously.
* **Feature branches** - Each new feature gets it's own branch and is only merged back with the master branch once it's ready.

Essentially Git is the tool and GitHub is a service provided for projects using Git.
